# OP Stack Acceptance Tests

## Overview

This directory contains the acceptance tests and configuration for the OP Stack. These tests are executed by `op-acceptor`, which serves as an automated gatekeeper for OP Stack network promotions.

Think of acceptance testing as Gandalf ðŸ§™, standing at the gates and shouting, "You shall not pass!" to networks that don't meet our standards. It enforces the "Don't trust, verify" principle by:

- Running automated acceptance tests
- Providing clear pass/fail results (and tracking these over time)
- Gating network promotions based on test results
- Providing insight into test feature/functional coverage

The `op-acceptor` ensures network quality and readiness by running a comprehensive suite of acceptance tests before features can advance through the promotion pipeline:

Localnet -> Alphanet â†’ Betanet â†’ Testnet

This process helps maintain high-quality standards across all networks in the OP Stack ecosystem.

## Dependencies

* Docker
* Kurtosis
* Mise (install as instructed in CONTRIBUTING.md)

Dependencies are managed using the repo-wide `mise` config. So ensure you've first run `mise install` at the repo root. If you need to manually modify the version of op-acceptor you wish to run you'll need to do it within the _mise.toml_ file at the repo root.

## Usage

The tests can be run using the `just` command runner:

```bash
# Run the default acceptance tests against a simple devnet
just

# Run the acceptance tests against a specific devnet and gate
just acceptance-test <devnet> <gate>

# Run the acceptance tests using a specific version of op-acceptor
ACCEPTOR_IMAGE=op-acceptor:latest just acceptance-test
```

### Configuration

- `acceptance-tests.yaml`: Defines the validation gates and the suites and tests that should be run for each gate.
- `justfile`: Contains the commands for running the acceptance tests.

## Adding New Tests

To add new acceptance tests:

1. Create your test in the appropriate Go package (as a regular Go test)
2. Register the test in `acceptance-tests.yaml` under the appropriate gate
3. Follow the existing pattern for test registration:
   ```yaml
   - name: YourTestName
     package: github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/your/package/path
   ```
